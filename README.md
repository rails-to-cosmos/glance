# Glance: Stateful Org-mode REPL

**Glance** is a stateful REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that supports org-mode syntax, providing comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality for org-mode files. It parses org-mode syntax line by line while preserving state, such as the current category and available TODO states.

The REPL supports various org-mode elements, such as:

- Headings
- Timestamps
- TODO items

Stateful parsing allows Glance to maintain context while processing org-mode files, making it easy to manage org-mode files programmatically. Whether you're looking to integrate org-mode functionality into your own applications, automate your org-mode workflows, or benefit from state-aware parsing in an interactive REPL environment, Glance has you covered.
