**Glance** is a stateful org-mode repl for power users.

The goal of this project is to allow users to manage their org-mode files interactively.

Browse bookmarks, encrypt or extract credentials, and search the graph of entities using custom dimension types.

I am experimenting with the design of interactive graph management, making the underlying data structures git-friendly and applying functional semantics like Type Classes to enhance the daily experience of power users.
