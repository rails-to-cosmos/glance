# Glance: Stateful Org-mode REPL

**Glance** is a stateful org-mode repl for power users.

The goal of this project is to allow users to manage their org-mode files interactively.

Browse bookmarks, encrypt/extract credentials, search through the graph of entities through custom dimension types.

I am experimenting with interactive graph management design, making underlying data structures git-friendly and applying handy functional semantics (such as Type Classes) to an everyday life of power user.
